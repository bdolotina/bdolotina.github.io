# Intro

Python and R are both programming languages that are extremely useful for data wrangling and analysis, especially in the realm of computational biology and bioinformatics. Some examples of this can be seen below.

#R and Python 

I will be starting in R by assigning the follow string of characters to `TheHard`.


```{R}
library(reticulate)
TheHard = "Chloe x Halle's album Ungodly Hour"
```

Next, I will be switching to python, and save a different string of characters as `Truth`. Then, I am going to print out these strings together in the same python code chunk by using the print function.

```{python}
Truth = "is the best album of 2020."
print(r.TheHard, Truth)
```

As we can see, `Ungodly Hour` is indeed the best album of 2020.
