# Intro

Python and R are both programming languages that are extremely useful for data wrangling and analysis, especially in the realm of computational biology and bioinformatics. Some examples of this can be seen below.

#R and Python 

I will be starting in R by assigning the follow string of characters to `TheHard`.


```{R}
library(reticulate)
TheHard = "Chloe x Halle's album Ungodly Hour"
```

Next, I will be switching to Python, and save a different string of characters as `Truth`. Then, I am going to print out these strings together in the same python code chunk by using the print function.

```{python}
Truth = "is the best album of 2020."
print(r.TheHard, Truth)
```

As we can see, `Ungodly Hour` is indeed the best album of 2020.

Next, we're going to see this claim in quantitative data by creating a vector of ratings for Ungodly Hour taken from a random sample.

```{R}
rating = c(10,10,10,10,9.5,10,9.5,10,10,10)
mean(rating)
```

As we can see from the above R code, the average rating amongst this sample is 9.9. To confirm these results, we will also calculate the mean in Python.

```{python}
import numpy as np
np.mean(r.rating)
```

And would you look at that! Also a 9.9, which we will graciously round to a 10! As we can see, both R and Python are great programming languages for us to elucidate the clear truths of this world. I hope that you will take this class in the future so that you too can know Ungodly Hour as the best album of 2020.
