This UN dataset details multiple social indicators for health, welfare, and education for 213 places (most of which are members of the UN). I acquired these data through the carsData, and they contain variables such as life expectancy, total fertility rate, infant mortality, percent urban, and per capita GDP in US dollars.</description>
