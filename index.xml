      <description>Intro Python and R are both programming languages that are extremely useful for data wrangling and analysis, especially in the realm of computational biology and bioinformatics. Some examples of this can be seen below.
 R and Python I will be starting in R by assigning the follow string of characters to TheHard.
library(reticulate) TheHard = &amp;quot;Chloe x Halle&amp;#39;s album Ungodly Hour&amp;quot; Next, I will be switching to python, and save a different string of characters as Truth.</description>

      <description>0. Introduction The two datasets I have chosen are artificially created from the larger United Nations (UN) dataset provided by R. This UN dataset details multiple social indicators for health, welfare, and education for 213 places (most of which are members of the UN). I acquired these data through the carsData, and they contain variables such as life expectancy, total fertility rate, infant mortality, percent urban, and per capita GDP in US dollars.</description>

      <description>Modeling 0. (5 pts) library(robustbase) crohnD = CrohnD This data set was from a study on 117 patients (therefore, 117 observations) affected by Crohn&#39;s disease, which is a chronic inflammatory disease that is localized in the intestines. It contains 9 variables: patient ID (unique number for each patient), number of adverse events, BMI (with units of kg/m^2), height (in centimeters), country (dichotomous variable, patient is either from country 1 or country 2), sex (male or female), age (in years), weight (in kilograms), and treatment (placebo, drug 1, or drug 2).</description>
